## Project1: Sound -> Image
```
1. Model Structure:
  - [x] use spatial dropout
  - [-] implement U-net++ structureã€€----------(PURGED)
  - [x] implement resnet block
  - [x] implement inverted residual block
  - [x] implement self-attention
  - [x] implement squeeze exitation block
  - [x] implement handling spectal normalization
  - [x] implement Multi method normalization
  - [x] implement Batch-Instance normalization
  - [-] implement Cycle-GAN structure  ----------(NOT YET, NOW PURGED)
  - [ ] implement GAN structure (main model)
2. Preprocessing
  - [x] SOUND:
    - [x] STFT handling
    - [x] Normalizer
  - [ ] IMAGE: implement image Normalizer
3. DATASET
  - [x] video splitter
      - 1. extract frames, sound from video.
      - 2. parallelize
  - [x] sound and frame custom data loader for build datasets
  - [x] multiple audio files handle on stft
4. Training
  - [ ] LATER
5. Testing
  - [ ] LATER
6. APPLY MULTI GPUs
  - [ ] LATER
7. make package
  - [ ] Define command use fire library
  - [x] Define & Build docker image
